Requirements:
   install c++ boost library
   One way to install it on Ubuntu is: sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

Compile:
   run makefile: make

Run:
   parameters: which motif, numberOfLayers, threshold, network name (file path)
   e.g. ./motif 2 10 0.6 testNetwork

   Note: 
   1. our code support four motif type: 1. feedforward loop,  2. bifan,  3. bi-parallel, 4. cascade and delay
   2. threshold: a number between 0 and 1
   3. We print the selected motifs by edges, we also report the number of motifs and running time.
   4. We also collect the nodes of selected motifs. You can check it by checking variable 'motifNodeSet'.


Format of the network file:

An edge is represented as (seperated by tab):
   SourceNode	DestNode

We seperate two layers using '---------'

e.g.

1	2
2	3
------
1	3
2	3
------
